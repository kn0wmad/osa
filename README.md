## "Libre tools for Liberty"

## Welcome to Open Source Autonomy (OSA)
Many of us have a feeling that we cannot explain.  We may begin to feel this as children.  It is a feeling that something is not quite right in the world around us.  It is a subconscious feeling that seems to float its way into the conscious mind from time to time, like it's gasping for air.  If you've found your way here, it's likely that you have begun to let this feeling breathe.  Here at Open Source Autonomy (OSA), we seek to provide "Libre Tools for Liberty."
