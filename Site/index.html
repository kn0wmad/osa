    Welcome to Open Source Autonomy. <br><br>
    Many of us have a feeling that we cannot explain.  We may begin to feel this as children.  It is a feeling that something
    is not quite right in the world around us.  It is a subconscious feeling that seems to float its way into the conscious
    mind from time to time, like it's gasping for air.  If you've found your way here, it's likely that you have begun to
    let this feeling breathe.  You are not alone.

<!-- <h3>Providence (n.) - foresight.  From the Latin - pro, "ahead" + videre, "to see"</h3>
      <p>
          The ability "to see ahead," is vitally important.  This ability is required to achieve the goals we strive for as a species.
